### INTRODUCTION
A blind spot is a part of the road that cannot be noticed by looking forward through your rear-view and side-view mirrors. Blind spots can be large enough to block the vision of another automobile, motorcycle, bicycle, or pedestrian. Blind spots exist in all cars, including the front, back,and both sides of the vehicle. Bigger vehicles, such as trucks, trailers, and buses, have significantly larger blind spot area or zones.
Blind spot incidents happened when one or more drivers change lanes while driving and fail to detect another car in their blind area, resulting in a collision with the other vehicle on the road. When changing lanes, car accidents like these are often occur. Currently, there is no system that can give notice or alert to riders when they are in a blind spot of another vehicle. To solve this, we proposed a project which is blind spot detection and tracker. We believe that this project is able to help to reduce accident rate involving motorcycles. 
Our aim is that by doing this project, the rider society will be able to identify each vehicles blind spot around them and might be able to create an environment for them to be more careful and aware of their surroundings.

### OBJECTIVE
1.To design a blind spot detection algorithm based on vehicle image.

2.To develop a blind spot tracker for e-hailing riders(BSTeRs) to detect blind spot area.

3.To implement BSTeRs on e-hailing for motorcycles.
